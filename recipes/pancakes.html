        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup wheat germ</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>5 1/3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, wheat germ or oats, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes</li>
